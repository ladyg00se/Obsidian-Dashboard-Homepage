# 🌿 Obsidian Dashboard / Homepage  

This is a **WIP (Work in Progress)** Obsidian Dashboard / Homepage.  
I was looking for a way to better manage my life, since I am working on a lot of project in my free-time, while also being employed and a part time student. I really liked the Notion templates,  
but I wasn’t a big fan of having all my data online.  

That’s why I started building this Dashboard – a place to manage different aspects of life:  
- ✅ Daily ToDo’s
- ✳️ ᴛᴏ ᴅᴏ for the next 7 days, next 30 days and the stuff which takes place afterwards
- 📂 Quick access to current projects  
- 🗓️ Day planning with timeboxing
- 🎂 ʙɪʀᴛʜᴅᴀʏs
- 🌱 ʟɪɴᴋs to all the other userful things in life

If you’re interested, feel free to put this Repository on your **watch list** –  
I try to update my Dashboard weekly with new features.  

Currently, it has a more **playful green aesthetic**, but there will also be a **minimalistic version**.  
Since I use a lot of community plugins, please also check out their repositories –  
there are many great and useful projects!
